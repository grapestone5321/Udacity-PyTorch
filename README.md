# Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch

In this course, you’ll learn the basics of deep learning, and build your own deep neural networks using PyTorch. 

You’ll get practical experience with PyTorch through coding exercises and projects implementing state-of-the-art AI applications such as style transfer and text generation.


### LESSON 1: Welcome to the course!

Welcome to this course on deep learning with PyTorch!


### LESSON 2: Introduction to Neural Networks

Learn the concepts behind how neural networks operate and how we train them using data.


### LESSON 3: Talking PyTorch with Soumith Chintala

Hear from Soumith Chintala, the creator of PyTorch, about the past, present, and future of the PyTorch framework.


### LESSON 4: Introduction to PyTorch

Learn how to use PyTorch to build and train deep neural networks. By the end of this lesson, you will build a network that can classify images of dogs and cats with state-of-the-art performance.


### LESSON 5: Convolutional Neural Networks

Learn how to use convolutional neural networks to build state-of-the-art computer vision models.


### LESSON 6: Style Transfer

Use a deep neural network to transfer the artistic style of one image onto another image.


### LESSON 7: Recurrent Neural Networks

Learn how to use recurrent neural networks to learn from sequential data such as text. Build a network that can generate realistic text one letter at a time.


### LESSON 8: Sentiment Prediction RNNs

Here you'll build a recurrent neural network that can accurately predict the sentiment of movie reviews.


### LESSON 9: Deploying PyTorch Models

In this lesson, we'll walk through a tutorial showing how to deploy PyTorch models with Torch Script.
